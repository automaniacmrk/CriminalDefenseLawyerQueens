<h1>What The Criminal Defense Lawyer Needs To Know</h1>
<p>The lawyer will ask several questions at your initial meeting. The questions could be related to your life and the circumstances that led you there, as well as your past and future court appearances. It may be a good idea to write down all relevant background information in preparation for the meeting.</p>
<h2>Test it</h2>
<p>At trial, the prosecution will present their evidence to the judge or the jury. The fate of the defendant will depend on which type of trial was used. Trials will result in either a conviction, where you are deemed guilty of the offense, or an acquittal, where you are determined to be not guilty. If convicted, you will be sentenced. You can be freed if you're acquitted.</p>

<h2>Queens County Court Directions And Parking</h2>
<p>When coming to the Criminal Court in Queens, please note that it is located on the East side of Queens Boulevard between Union Turnpike and the Van Wyck Expressway. Since 2014, it has been difficult to find parking since the lot was shut down. There is a private lot across the street and to the east there is street parking in the neighborhood behind the courthouse.</p>
<h2>Drug offenses</h2>
<p>Attorney Michael Vitaliano provides his clients with representation for a number of high-level drug crimes like drug possession, drug possession with intent to sell, drug manufacturing, and drug trafficking. New York does not take drug crimes lightly. This includes high-level offenses involving Schedule I and Schedule II drugs such as heroin or cocaine. Penalties for drug-related offenses in New York can include heavy fines, jail or prison time, and supervised probation.</p>
<p>New York has specific penalties and consequences for certain drug crimes. It can be difficult to convince the prosecution that you will not face any punishments. Attorney Vitaliano, a former prosecutor knows that this is true and can negotiate with the prosecution to protect your rights.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.tsiglerlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/our-new-york-criminal-defense-lawyers.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Criminal Defense Lawyer Queens" width="80%" height="auto"></h2>
<h2>Queens Criminal Lawyers</h2>
<p>Three types of criminal offenses can be classified: felonies (or misdemeanors), infractions (or infractions). The most severe crimes, such as robbery and violence, are the felonies. In New York City, misdemeanor charges may include trespassing, vandalism, drug possession, prostitution, disorderly conduct, drug possession, petty theft and animal crimes. Infractions include fines and traffic tickets. A criminal charge can alter your life dramatically. Again, having a criminal record can have far reaching consequences such as employment prospects and even getting insurance. It is in your best interests to speak with a Queens criminal attorney if you face a criminal case. You may be able to negotiate a lower sentence or plea deal.</p>
<p>You need to be familiar with the penalties that can apply for criminal offenses in Queens, NYC, in order to understand the importance of a skilled defense attorney. A Class A misdemeanor is a crime that can land you in jail for up to 12 months. Drug possession, assault and theft are all examples of Class A misdemeanors. A non-violent misdemeanor may not result in jail time. It should be understood that it is not something to take lightly. It is determined by the crime and defense strategy as well as the court. The verdict and disposition are decided by the judges. Certain courts in Queens impose jail term for misdemeanors. Crimes such as Driving While Intoxicated in New York are treated seriously, and you stand to face license suspension. You will be paying higher insurance premiums for the future because of this.</p>
<p>Criminal charges could have long-lasting negative effects on your life. Legal expertise is essential when so much is at risk. While a criminal offense is damaging, a good lawyer will come up with a defense. It is a strategy argument which challenges the validity and sufficiency of the case brought against the defendant. There are several possible defenses that a Queens criminal lawyer can use in your defense:</p>
<p>Presumption of innocence</p>
<p>Every accused party is presumed innocent unless proven guilty through a plea or trial. This means that the prosecutor must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. When using the presumption of innocence as a defense, the defendant may choose to remain silent and wait for the prosecutor to present their case. The criminal defense attorney can argue that the prosecution has not proved their case against the client, or point out flaws in the prosecutorâs case. For many jurors, the burden of proof rests on the prosecution. They can ask for more evidence or dismissal of the case.</p>
<p>Self-Defense</p>
<p>Self-defense is a possible defense strategy especially for crimes such as murder, battery, and assault with a deadly weapon. Self-defense strategies require the defendant to admit that they committed an offense, but not in order to defend himself. In self-defense cases, there are several important issues the jury or judge will take into consideration. First, determine the aggressor. Also consider if the defendant and aggressor have had a previous relationship. A criminal defense attorney must prove that the defendant believed that self-defense was necessary. It is important to consider the use of force and weapon choice if self-defense is justified. The right to defend oneself from any foreseeable danger is self-defense. The circumstances surrounding a self-defense act are varied. However, the underlying expectation is that the force applied should be reasonable.</p>
<p>Under the Influence</p>
<p>Committing a crime under the influence of alcohol or other drugs can be a defense. One can argue that they were mentally impaired and they should not be held accountable for the crimes committed. Even though this defense is weak, it does not excuse the defendant from any charges. The court can issue a lesser penalty for intoxication, but the prosecution may still be brought against the defendant. This defense requires a good defense lawyer.</p>
<p>Defence of Duress</p>
<p>An accused can claim that they were compelled to commit crimes by another person. They were threatened with bodily injury if they didn't comply in this instance. This defense is especially useful for minors. The defendant also needs to demonstrate that the threat was immediate and unavoidable.</p>
<p>The Defense of Mistake</p>
<p>Although ignorance cannot be used as a defense, it is possible for the defendant to have committed an offense by error. For instance, a bar attender who serves a drink to an underage customer who has a fake ID. In such a case, if the court believes that the customer can be mistaken to be of age, then the defense might hold.</p>
<p>The defenses presented are based on the unique circumstances of the case. This is why is it wise to have your case reviewed by an experienced Queens criminal lawyer. The lawyer will then prepare a defense strategy based on the merits of your case.</p>
<p>The Queens criminal lawyers at Spodek Law Group P.C. prepare each and every case for trial. We believe that you must outwork the prosecution and leave no stone unturned.

<p>We have Queens Defense Lawyers and former Queens Assistant District Attorneys. To discuss Queens' criminal cases, we are open 24/7. Call us at 718-793-5555.</p>
<p>You will be first processed by the law enforcement local precinct if you have been arrested in Queens County New York or JFK Airport. It is usually the NYPD Precinct located in the exact area where the crime took place. If you were arrested at JFK airport, you will be taken to the Port Authority Precinct. The JFK case is often for firearm possession, forged identification, or transporting a controlled substance.</p>
<p>The new arrest will then be processed at the precinct and an arrest number issued. This arrest number is the number that will allow you to track the new arrest as he or she makes their way through the system. It will look something like Q123456 The new arrest will then be transported to Queens Central Booking for their arraignment. You can find the courthouse at 125-01 Queens Boulevard. Above is the Queens County Criminal Courthouse.</p>
<p>In the New York Criminal Justice System, criminal court arraignments serve a limited purpose. It is not, to determine the guilt of innocence of the defendant but rather to decide whether the defendant should be released on his or her own recognizance, remanded, or bail should be set. This is a crucial decision. A lawyer should prepare for the hearing as soon as possible to ensure that the defendant is released from jail.</p>
<p>Law Offices of Michael Dreishpoon at 718-793-5555 24/7 to speak to a Queens Criminal Lawyer</p>
<p>Queens Arraignment Attorney</p>
<p>Although the criminal law and procedure in New York State are the same throughout, each district attorneys office has their own nuances that a criminal lawyer needs to be aware of. There are two key issues that Queens County has to be aware of. First, the Queens County District Attorneys office has no plea policy when it comes to new felony arrests. What this means is that if you are arrested and charged with a felony in Queens County, and you want to plea bargain the Assistant District Attorney will ask you to sign a waiver. You are waiving CPL 180.80 and CPL 190.80 as well as constitutional rights. A criminal defense must understand the ramifications of what he is signing so that he can make an informed decision.</p>
<p>Queens County's pre-arraignment interrogation policies is another unique issue. The way this works, prior to an arraignment they will bring the defendant to a conference room and attempt to interview them prior to the defendant speaking to a lawyer. The script will be read out to defendants.</p>
<p>In a few minutes I'm going to read you your rights. After that, you'll be given an opportunity to explain what happened at that date, time and place.</p>
<p>Please give as many details as possible if you believe you have an alibi. This includes the names of all people with whom you may have been.</p>
<p>This is your chance to share your view of what happened that day.</p>
<p>Please let us know if there are any questions regarding this incident.</p>
<p>Even if you have already spoken to someone else, you do not have to talk to me.</p>
<p>This will be the only opportunity you will have to talk to me prior to your arraignment on these charges.</p>
<p>The entire interview will be recorded using both sound and video</p>
<p>You have the right to remain silent. Any statement you make can be and will be used against your in court. An attorney is available to you. You can get one if you are unable to afford it.</p>
<p>Are you able to understand what I just said? Do you want to talk about these rights?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, criminal defendants are nervous and want to talk. Often times, they say something that they believe will help them but in fact only puts them in worse situation. As soon as we are retained, we immediately assert our clients right to remain silent and do everything we can to protect them.</p>
